A lit Java program for ETH students to automatically download all their exercises and all available solutions and material.
Currently only works for the first semester of Computer Science BSc.

If you want to build it yourself, you need Jsoup and Apache Commons IO.
You can also just use the jar file in the build folder: `java -jar us.jar`
